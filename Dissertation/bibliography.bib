	abstract = {The promise of quantum computers is that certain computational tasks might be executed exponentially faster on a quantum processor than on a classical processor1. A fundamental challenge is to build a high-fidelity processor capable of running quantum algorithms in an exponentially large computational space. Here we report the use of a processor with programmable superconducting qubits2–7 to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a computational state-space of dimension 253 (about 1016). Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times—our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy8–14 for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07965},
	abstract = {This paper reports the development of an electronic system for the control and readout of superconducting qubits. The system includes a timing control module (TCM), four-channel arbitrary waveform generators (AWGs), four-channel data acquisition modules (DAQs), six-channel bias voltage generators (BVGs), a controller card, and mixers. The AWGs have a 2-GSa/s sampling rate and a 14-bit amplitude resolution. The DAQs provide a 1-GSa/s sampling rate and 12-bit amplitude resolution. The BVGs provide an ultra-precise DC voltage with a noise level of {\textasciitilde}6 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}Vp-p. The TCM sends system clock and global triggers to each module through a high-speed backplane to achieve precise timing control. These modules are implemented in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). While achieving highly customized functions, the physical interface and communication protocol are compatible with each other. The modular design is suitable for quantum computing experiments of different scales up to hundreds of qubits. We implement a real-time digital signal processing system in the FPGA, enabling precise timing control, arbitrary waveform generation, parallel IQ demodulation for qubit state discrimination, and the generation of real-time qubit-state-dependent trigger signals for active feedback control. We demonstrate the functionalities and performance of this system using a fluxonium quantum processor.},

	abstract = {The next generation of cryogenic CMB and submillimeter cameras under development require densely instrumented sensor arrays to meet their science goals. The readout of large numbers ({\textasciitilde}10,000-100,000 per camera) of sub-Kelvin sensors, for instance as proposed for the CMB-S4 experiment, will require substantial improvements in cold and warm readout techniques. To reduce the readout cost per sensor and integration complexity, efforts are presently focused on achieving higher multiplexing density while maintaining readout noise subdominant to intrinsic detector noise and presenting manageable thermal loads. Highly-multiplexed cold readout technologies in active development include Microwave Kinetic Inductance Sensors (MKIDs) and microwave rf-SQUIDs. Both exploit the high quality factors of superconducting microwave resonators to densely channelize sub-Kelvin sensors into the bandwidth of a microwave transmission line. In the case of microwave SQUID multiplexing, arrays of transition-edge sensors (TES) are multiplexed by coupling each TES to its own superconducting microwave resonator through an rf-SQUID. We present advancements in the development of a new warm readout system for microwave SQUID multiplexing, the SLAC Superconducting Microresonator RF electronics, or SMuRF, by adapting SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory's Advanced Telecommunications Computing Architecture (ATCA) FPGA Common Platform. SMuRF aims to read out 4000 microwave SQUID channels between 4 and 8 GHz per RF line. Each compact SMuRF system is built onto a single ATCA carrier blade. Daughter boards on the blade implement RF frequency-division multiplexing using FPGAs, fast DACs and ADCs, and an analog up- and down-conversion chain. The system reads out changes in flux in each resonator-coupled rf-SQUID by monitoring the change in the transmitted amplitude and frequency of RF tones produced at each resonator's fundamental frequency. The SMuRF system is unique in its ability to track each tone, minimizing the total RF power required to readout each resonator, thereby significantly reducing the linearity requirements on the cold and warm readout. Here, we present measurements of the readout noise and linearity of the first full SMuRF system, including a demonstration of closed-loop tone tracking on a 528 channel cryogenic microwave SQUID multiplexer. SMuRF is being explored as a potential readout solution for a number of future CMB projects including Simons Observatory, BICEP Array, CCAT-prime, Ali-CPT, and CMB-S4. In addition, parallel development of the platform is underway to adapt SMuRF to read out both MKID and fast X-ray TES calorimeter arrays.},

The superconducting qubit modality has been used to demonstrate prototype algorithms in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) technology era, in which non-error-corrected qubits are used to implement quantum simulations and quantum algorithms. With the recent demonstrations of multiple high-fidelity, two-qubit gates as well as operations on logical qubits in extensible superconducting qubit systems, this modality also holds promise for the longer-term goal of building larger-scale error-corrected quantum computers. In this brief review, we discuss several of the recent experimental advances in qubit hardware, gate implementations, readout capabilities, early NISQ algorithm implementations, and quantum error correction using superconducting qubits. Although continued work on many aspects of this technology is certainly necessary, the pace of both conceptual and technical progress in recent years has been impressive, and here we hope to convey the excitement stemming from this progress.},

Here we describe the first successful effort to create a photon-counting, energy-resolving ultraviolet, optical, and near infrared MKID focal plane array. These new Optical Lumped Element (OLE) MKID arrays have significant advantages over semiconductor detectors like charge coupled devices (CCDs). They can count individual photons with essentially no false counts and determine the energy and arrival time of every photon with good quantum efficiency. Their physical pixel size and maximum count rate is well matched with large telescopes. These capabilities enable powerful new astrophysical instruments usable from the ground and space. MKIDs could eventually supplant semiconductor detectors for most astronomical instrumentation, and will be useful for other disciplines such as quantum optics and biological imaging.},

These microresonators take the form of microwave SQUIDs that couple to transition-edge sensors or microwave kinetic inductance detectors. In principle, such arrays can be read out with vastly scalable software-defined radio using suitable FPGAs, ADCs and DACs.

Closed-loop tone tracking enables improved system linearity, a significant increase in sensor count per readout line, and the possibility of overcoupled resonator designs for enhanced dynamic range.

In dynamic experiments, real-time qubit state information is fed back or fed forward within a fraction of the qubits’ coherence time to dynamically change the implemented sequence. The hardware presented here covers both control and readout of superconducting qubits. For readout, we created a custom signal processing gateware and software stack on commercial hardware to convert pulses in a heterodyne receiver into qubit state assignments with minimal latency, alongside data taking capability. For control, we developed custom hardware with gateware and software for pulse sequencing and steering information distribution that is capable of arbitrary control flow in a fraction of superconducting qubit coherence times. Both readout and control platforms make extensive use of field programmable gate arrays to enable tailored qubit control systems in a reconfigurable fabric suitable for iterative development.},

Our system retains much of the core signal processing architecture from the first generation system but with a significantly higher bandwidth, enabling the readout of kilopixel MKID arrays. Each set of readout boards is capable of reading out 1024 MKID pixels multiplexed over 2 GHz of bandwidth; two such units can be placed in parallel to read out a full 2048 pixel microwave feedline over a 4 GHz–8 GHz band. As in the first generation readout, our system is capable of identifying, analyzing, and recording photon detection events in real time with a time resolution of order a few microseconds. Here, we describe the hardware and firmware, and present an analysis of the noise properties of the system. We also present a novel algorithm for efficiently suppressing IQ mixer sidebands to below −30 dBc.},

	abstract = {We review the salient features of two advanced nodes of an 8-Nb-layer fully planarized process developed recently at MIT Lincoln Laboratory for fabricating single flux quantum (SFQ) digital circuits with very large-scale integration on 200-mm wafers: the SFQ4ee and SFQ5ee nodes, where “ee” denotes that the process is tuned for energy-efficient SFQ circuits. The former has eight superconducting layers with 0.5-μm minimum feature size and a 2-Ω/sq Mo layer for circuit resistors. The latter has nine superconducting layers: eight Nb wiring layers with the minimum feature size of 350 nm and a thin superconducting MoNx layer (Tc 7.5 K) with high kinetic inductance (about 8 pH/sq) for forming compact inductors. A nonsuperconducting (Tc {\textless}; 2 K) MoNx layer with lower nitrogen content is used for 6-Ω/sq planar resistors for shunting and biasing of Josephson junctions (JJs). Another resistive layer is added to form interlayer sandwich-type resistors of milliohm range for releasing unwanted flux quanta from superconducting loops of logic cells. Both process nodes use Au/Pt/Ti contact metallization for chip packaging. The technology utilizes one layer of Nb/AlOx-Al/Nb JJs with critical current density Jc of 100 μA/μm2 and minimum diameter of 700 nm. Circuit patterns are defined by 248-nm photolithography and high-density plasma etching. All circuit layers are fully planarized using chemical mechanical planarization of SiO2 interlayer dielectric. The following results and topics are presented and discussed: the effect of surface topography under the JJs on the their properties and repeatability, Ic and Jc targeting, effect of hydrogen dissolved in Nb, MoNx properties for the resistor layer and for high-kinetic-inductance layer, and technology of milliohm-range resistors.},

	abstract = {Hafnium is an elemental superconductor which crystallizes in a hexagonal close packed structure, has a transition temperature \$T\_\{C\} {\textbackslash}simeq 400 mK\$, and has a high normal state resistivity around \$90 {\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}Omega. cm\$. In Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs), these properties are advantageous since they allow for creating detectors sensitive to optical and near infra-red radiation. In this work, we study how sputter conditions and especially the power applied to the target during the deposition, affect the hafnium \$T\_\{C\}\$, resistivity, stress, texture and preferred crystal orientation. We find that the position of the target with respect to the substrate strongly affects the orientation of the crystallites in the films and the internal quality factor, \$Q\_\{i\}\$, of MKIDs fabricated from the films. In particular, we demonstrate that a DC magnetron sputter deposition at a normal angle of incidence, low pressure, and low plasma power promotes the growth of compressive (002)-oriented films and that such films can be used to make high quality factor MKIDs with \$Q\_\{i\}\$ up to 600,000.},

In this paper, we present an SDR demonstration system based on the Xilinx RFSoC platform, which leverages the Python-based `PYNQ' (Python Productivity for Zynq) software framework. In doing so, we highlight features that can be extremely useful for prototyping radio system design. Notably, our developed system features Python-based control of hardware processing blocks and Radio Frequency (RF) data converters, as well as direct visualisation of communications signals captured within the chip. The system architecture is reviewed, hardware and software components are discussed, functionality is demonstrated, and aspects of the system's performance are evaluated. Finally, it is noted that this combined RFSoC + PYNQ approach is readily extensible for other SDR systems; we highlight our online shared resources, and invite other engineers to investigate and build upon our work.},

ROACH is an open-source hardware and software platform featuring a large Xilinx Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), Power PC processor, several 10 GB Ethernet SFP+ interfaces, and a collection of daughter boards for analog signal generation and acquisition. The combination of a ROACH board, ADC/DAC conversion daughter boards, and hardware for RF mixing allows for the generation and capture of multiple RF tones for reading out microwave multiplexed X-ray TES microcalorimeters. The FPGA is used to generate multiple tones in base band, from 10 MHz to 250 MHz, which are subsequently mixed to RF in the multiple GHz range and sent through the microwave multiplexer. The tones are generated in the FPGA by storing a large lookup table in Quad Data Rate SRAM modules and playing out the waveform to a DAC board. Once the signal has been modulated to RF, passed through the microwave multiplexer, and has been modulated back to base band, the signal is digitized by an ADC board. The tones are modulated to 0 Hz by using a FPGA circuit consisting of a polyphase filter bank, several Xilinx FFT blocks, Xilinx CORDIC blocks (for converting to magnitude and phase), and special phase accumulator circuit for mixing to exactly 0 Hz. Upwards of 256 channels can be simultaneously captured and written into a bank of 256 First-In-First-Out (FIFO) memories, with each FIFO corresponding to a channel. Individual channel data can be further processed in the FPGA before being streamed through a 10 GB Ethernet fiber-optic interface to a Linux system. The Linux system runs software written in Python and QT C++ for controlling the ROACH system, capturing data, and processing data.},

These microcalorimeters measure the energy released in the absorption of a single photon by sensing the rise in temperature of a small absorbing structure. The ultimate energy resolution of such a device is limited by the thermodynamic power fluctuations in the thermal link between the calorimeter and isothermal bath and can in principle be made as low as 1 eV. The performance of a real device is degraded due to noise contributions such as excess 1/f noise in the thermistor and incomplete conversion of energy into phonons. The authors report some recent advances in thermometry, X-ray absorption and thermalization, fabrication techniques, and detector optimization in the presence of noise. These improvements have resulted in a device with a spectral resolution of 17 eV FWHM, measured at 6 keV.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

Both microcalorimeter arrays and higher per pixel count rates are desirable to increase the total throughput of spectrometers based on these devices. The millisecond recovery time of gamma-ray microcalorimeters and the resulting pulse pileup are significant obstacles to high per pixel count rates. Here, we demonstrate operation of a microcalorimeter detector at elevated count rates by use of convolution filters designed to be orthogonal to the exponential tail of a preceding pulse. These filters allow operation at 50\% higher count rates than conventional filters while largely preserving sensor energy resolution.},

The energy spectrum is reported from a blind analysis with 1.2 g-days of exposure acquired in an above-ground laboratory. With charge carrier trapping and impact ionization effects incorporated into the dark matter signal models, the dark matter-electron cross section ¯σe is constrained for dark matter masses from 0.5 to 104 MeV/c2; in the mass range from 1.2 to 50 eV/c2 the dark photon kinetic mixing parameter ϵ and the axioelectric coupling constant gae are constrained.

	abstract = {A noiseless, photon-counting detector, which resolves the energy of each photon, could radically change astronomy, biophysics, and quantum optics. Superconducting detectors promise an intrinsic resolving power at visible wavelengths of R=E/δE≈100 due to their low excitation energy. We study superconducting energy-resolving microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs), which hold particular promise for larger cameras. A visible and near-infrared photon absorbed in the superconductor creates a few thousand quasiparticles through several stages of electron-phonon interaction. Here we demonstrate experimentally that the resolving power of MKIDs at visible to near-infrared wavelengths is limited by the loss of hot phonons during this process. We measure the resolving power of our aluminum-based detector as a function of photon energy using four lasers with wavelengths between 1545–402nm. For detectors on thick SiN/Si and sapphire substrates the resolving power is limited to 10–21 for the respective wavelengths, consistent with the loss of hot phonons. When we suspend the sensitive part of the detector on a 110-nm-thick SiN membrane, the measured resolving power improves to 19–52, respectively. The improvement is equivalent to a factor 8±2 stronger phonon trapping on the membrane, which is consistent with a geometrical phonon propagation model for these hot phonons. We discuss a route towards the Fano limit by phonon engineering.},

	abstract = {In 2015, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) community started planning CMB Stage IV (CMBS4), which aims to make definitive measurements of the early universe with {\textasciitilde}500,000 detectors. To reach this number of detectors, the CMB-S4 Concept Definition Task Force found that “Investment is needed in proving process uniformity and reproducibility in TES polarimeter fabrication. In addition, cost reduction could potentially be achieved…by exploring commercial fabrication options.” As part of this effort, Dr. Aritoki Suzuki of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) began working with Seeqc, Inc. (formerly a division of HYPRES, Inc.) on fabrication of antenna coupled transition edge sensor (TES) bolometers at Seeqc’s commercial Niobium foundry. Phase I was a study in integrating low loss superconducting resonators on the same wafer as the bolometer arrays for frequency domain multiplexing (FDM). In Phase II, we made several achievements advancing Seeqc’s ability to fabricate high quality TES detector wafers. First, we transitioned the remaining fabrication steps from LBNL to Seeqc and demonstrated complete end-to-end commercial fabrication of TES detector wafers. Second, we demonstrated an ability to optimize fabrication steps, including developing a low loss/low stress SiN film that balances the need for high optical efficiency with the need for low film stress. Finally, we showed that integrated LC resonators, redesigned for higher frequencies, can be used to measure the RF loss tangent in the detector wafer’s SiN dielectric, which can be used for process monitoring during high throughput detector fabrication runs. As a result of our Phase II efforts, we are able to manufacture antenna coupled TES bolometer arrays that meet CMB experiment requirements in terms of T\_C, detector efficiency, and saturation power. And we have demonstrated able to fabricate detectors that can couple to all three leading readout methods (frequency domain multiplexing (FDM), time domain multiplexing (TDM) and microwave SQUID multiplexing (μmux).},

To overcome this limitation, we propose a scalable architecture to simultaneously connect several pairs of distant qubits via a dispersively coupled quantum bus. The building block of the bus is composed of orthogonal coplanar waveguide resonators connected through ancillary flux qubits working in the ultrastrong coupling regime. This regime activates virtual processes that boost the effective qubit–qubit interaction, which results in quantum gates on the nanosecond timescale. The interaction is switchable and preserves the coherence of the qubits.},

While the tensor-to-scalar ratio has been constrained to be \$\$r\_\{0.05\}{\textless}0.06\$\$ at 95\% c.l., further improvements on this upper limit are hindered by polarized galactic foreground emissions and removal of gravitational lensing polarization.

We will show the design of the 30/40 GHz detectors and test results summarizing its performance. The low optical and atmospheric loading at these frequencies requires our TES detectors to have low saturation power in order to be photon noise dominated.

An especially promising set of cold readout technologies couple cryogenic sensors to superconducting resonators. These technologies rely on high-frequency RF electronics to interrogate and demodulate the sensors’ signals using digitally generated tones. Recently released Radio Frequency Systems-on-Chip (RFSoC) devices from Xilinx combine a FPGA with high-speed ADCs and DACs onto a single chip. These systems provide significant advantages for these applications, including lower cost, reduced size and weight, lower power consumption, and improved RF performance. While an RFSoC-based warm readout system would be attractive for a broad range of spacecraft applications, Xilinx has not announced plans for a space qualified version of its RFSoC devices and insufficient data is publicly available to evaluate the feasibility of using RFSoC devices in space. To evaluate the suitability of RFSoC devices for spacecraft applications, we have designed and built custom boards using all space-qualified components except for the RFSoC. In this contribution we present the design of our custom RFSoC board, measurements of critical aspects of board performance which relate to operation in the harsh space environment, and measurements of integrated RF performance targeting the readout of large superconducting sensor arrays and space-based radio spectrometry. In addition to a wide range of spacecraft applications including communications and radar, our RFSoC platform is a potentially critically enabling technology for missions prioritized by the recent 2020 Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics including flagship Far-IR and X-ray missions, as well as Far-IR, X-ray, and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) probes.},

	abstract = {Communications at mm-wave frequencies and above rely heavily on beamforming antenna arrays. Typically, hundreds, if not thousands, of independent antenna channels are used to achieve high SNR for throughput and increased capacity. Using a dedicated ADC per antenna receiver is preferable but it’s not practical for very large arrays due to unreasonable cost and complexity. Frequency division multiplexing (FDM) is a well-known technique for combining multiple signals into a single wideband channel. In a first of its kind measurements, this paper explores FDM for combining multiple antenna outputs at IF into a single wideband signal that can be sampled and digitized using a high-speed wideband ADC. The sampled signals are sub-band filtered and digitally down-converted to obtain individual antenna channels. A prototype receiver was realized with a uniform linear array consisting of 4 elements with 250 MHz bandwidth per channel at 28 GHz carrier frequency. Each of the receiver chains were frequency-multiplexed at an intermediate frequency of 1 GHz to avoid the requirement for multiple, precise local oscillators (LOs). Combined narrowband receiver outputs were sampled using a single ADC with digital front-end operating on a Xilinx ZCU-1285 RF SoC FPGA to synthesize 4 digital beams. The approach allows \$M\$ -fold increase in spatial degrees of freedom per ADC, for temporal oversampling by a factor of \$M\$ .},

	abstract = {Backend systems for radio telescopes have tended to be designed specifically for the particular RF and IF frequencies and digitization bandwidth of the particular project. As analogue-to-digital conversion technology advances, it is becoming feasible and cost effective to develop receivers using wideband digitization with a common architecture. This project lead by the Oxford Experimental Radio Cosmology Group aims to design and develop a common receiver – down-conversion and digital backend – for a number of different telescopes. A down-conversion architecture using a single heterodyne step with IQ mixers and a baseband IF presents a common IF signal to the digitiser from a variety of RF signal sources. The Xilinx RF System-on-Chip device (RFSoC), which has RF ADCs integrated with and FPGA and processors, was selected as the platform for the backend. In this paper, the system architecture of the RFSoC-based digital backend, including the down-conversion circuit interfacing the existing electronics and RFSoC ADCs, will be described. We have performed a comprehensive performance characterization of the RFSoC ADCs, and the test results address concerns about the interleaved spurs, dynamic range, intermodulation distortion and long-term stability. We have successfully developed a real-sampling PFB-based spectrometer on the RFSoC platform and we are currently working on the IQ sampling PFB-based spectrometer. The latest test results for the IQ sampling spectrometer and the future development plan will be discussed in this paper. Applications of the common receiver system will include the CBASS-South telescope, the Goonhilly-3 29-m telescope, the Tulancingo 32-m telescope, and the Redshift Receiver on the Large Millimetre Telescope where the existing IF signal band is comparable to the RF band on the other systems.},

Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times—our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy8–14 for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm.},

A 54-qubit Sycamore processor was used to benchmark these devices, providing a calibration for readout power, an estimation of amplifier added noise, and a platform for comparison against standard impedance matched parametric amplifiers with a single dc-SQUID. We find that the high power rf-SQUID array design has no adverse effect on system noise, readout fidelity, or qubit dephasing, and we estimate an upper bound on amplifier added noise at 1.6 times the quantum limit. Finally, amplifiers with this design show no degradation in readout fidelity due to gain compression, which can occur in multi-tone multiplexed readout with traditional JPAs.},

	abstract = {Practical quantum computing will require error rates well below those achievable with physical qubits. Quantum error correction1,2 offers a path to algorithmically relevant error rates by encoding logical qubits within many physical qubits, for which increasing the number of physical qubits enhances protection against physical errors. However, introducing more qubits also increases the number of error sources, so the density of errors must be sufficiently low for logical performance to improve with increasing code size. Here we report the measurement of logical qubit performance scaling across several code sizes, and demonstrate that our system of superconducting qubits has sufficient performance to overcome the additional errors from increasing qubit number. We find that our distance-5 surface code logical qubit modestly outperforms an ensemble of distance-3 logical qubits on average, in terms of both logical error probability over 25 cycles and logical error per cycle ((2.914 ± 0.016)\% compared to (3.028 ± 0.023)\%). To investigate damaging, low-probability error sources, we run a distance-25 repetition code and observe a 1.7 × 10−6 logical error per cycle floor set by a single high-energy event (1.6 × 10−7 excluding this event). We accurately model our experiment, extracting error budgets that highlight the biggest challenges for future systems. These results mark an experimental demonstration in which quantum error correction begins to improve performance with increasing qubit number, illuminating the path to reaching the logical error rates required for computation.},

Until recently, quantum limited amplifiers have been incompatible with these detectors due to the dynamic range, power, and bandwidth constraints. However, we show that a kinetic inductance based traveling-wave parametric amplifier can be used for this application and reaches the quantum limit. The total system noise for this readout scheme was equal to ∼2.1 in units of quanta. For incident photons in the 800–1300 nm range, the amplifier increased the average resolving power of the detector from ∼6.7 to 9.3 at which point the resolution becomes limited by noise on the pulse height of the signal. Noise measurements suggest that a resolving power of up to 25 is possible if the redesigned detectors can remove this additional noise source.},

We report the design and fabrication of superconducting 53 wt\% Nb-47 wt\% Ti (Nb47Ti) FLexible coAXial ribbon cables (FLAX). The ten traces each consist of a ø0.076 mm NbTi inner conductor insulated with PFA (ø0.28 mm) and sheathed in a shared 0.025 mm thick Nb47Ti outer conductor. The cable is terminated with G3PO coaxial push-on connectors via stainless steel capillary tubing (ø1.6 mm, 0.13 mm thick) soldered to a coplanar wave guide transition board. The 30 cm long cable has 1 dB of loss at 8 GHz with -60 dB nearest neighbor forward cross talk. The loss is 0.5 dB more than commercially available superconducting coax likely due to impedance mismatches caused by manufacturing imperfections in the cable. The reported cross talk is 30 dB lower than previously developed laminated NbTi-on-Kapton microstrip cables. We estimate the heat load from 1 K to 90 mK to be 20 nW per trace, approximately half the computed load from the smallest commercially available superconducting coax from CryoCoax.},

The outer diameter is 1.60 mm, and both conductors are separated by dielectric material of PTFE. The coaxial cable revealed to become superconductive below about 10 K. The thermal conductance was measured between 0.4 and 6 K and consistent with literature. Performance at high frequency was also measured at 4.2 K. The attenuation was very small and less than 1 dB up to about 7 GHz.

The thermal conductivity of the 70-30 CuNi differed from the literature by 25\% at 0.36K and 40\% at 4.2K, and the alloy exhibited a weak temperature dependence, which indicated the effects of mechanical treatment. It has been confirmed that the thermal conduction of the coaxial cables are low enough to keep a cold stage of 3He cryostats at a temperature below 0.3K, even when one hundred cables are installed between 0.3 and 3K for the read-out of superconducting tunnel junction arrays.

	shorttitle = {{MEC}},
	doi = {10.1117/12.2311586},
	abstract = {Direct Imaging of exoplanets is one of the most technically difficult techniques used to study exoplanets, but holds immense promise for not just detecting but characterizing planets around the nearest stars. Ambitious instruments at the world’s largest telescopes have been built to carry out this science: the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI), SPHERE at VLT, SCExAO at Subaru, and the P1640 and Stellar Double Coronagraph (SDC) at Palomar. These instruments share a common archetype consisting of an extreme AO system feeding a coronagraph for on-axis stellar light rejection followed by a focal plane Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS). They are currently limited by uncontrolled scattered and diffracted light which produces a coherent speckle halo in the image plane. A number of differential imaging schemes exist to mitigate these issues resulting in star-planet contrast ratios as deep as {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}-6 at low angular separations. Surpassing this contrast limit requires high speed active speckle nullification from a focal plane wavefront sensor (FPWS) and new processing techniques. MEC, the Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector (MKID) Exoplanet Camera, is a J-band IFS module behind Subaru Telescope’s SCExAO system. MEC is capable of producing an image cube several thousand times a second without the read noise that dominates conventional high speed IFUs. This enables it to integrate with SCExAO as an extremely fast FPWS while eliminating non-common path aberrations by doubling as a science camera. Key science objectives can be further explored if longer wavelengths (H and K band) are simultaneously sent to CHARIS for high resolution spectroscopy. MEC, to be commissioned at Subaru in early 2018, is the second MKID IFS for high contrast imaging following DARKNESS’ debut at Palomar in July 2016. MEC will follow up on young planets and debris disks discovered in the SEEDS survey or by Project 1640 as well as discover self-luminous massive planets. The increased sensitivity, combined with the advanced coronagraphs in SCExAO which have inner working angles (IWAs) as small as 0.03” at 1.2 μm, allows young Jupiter-sized objects to be imaged as close as 4 AU from their host star. If the wavefront control enabled by MEC is fully realized, it may begin to probe the reflected light of giant planets around some nearby stars, opening a new parameter space for direct imaging targeting older stars. While direct imaging of reflected light exoplanets is the most challenging of the scientific goals, it is a promising long-term path towards characterization of habitable planets around nearby stars using Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs). With diameters of about 30-m, an ELT can resolve the habitable zones of nearby M-type stars, for which an Earth-sized planet would be at {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}(-7) contrast at 1 μm. This will complement future space-based high contrast optical imaging targeting the wider habitable zones of sun-like stars for {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}(-10) contrast earth analogs. We will present lessons learned from the first few months of MEC’s operation including initial lab and on-sky (weather permitting) results. We already have preliminary data from Palomar testing a new statistical speckle discrimination post-processing technique using the photon arrival time measured with MKIDs. Residual stellar light in the form of a speckle masquerading as a planetary companion is pulled from a modified Rician distribution and can be statistically discerned from a true off-axis Poisson point source. Additionally, the progress of active focal plane wavefront control will be briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {We present the MKID Exoplanet Camera (MEC), a z through J band (800–1400 nm) integral field spectrograph located behind The Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) at the Subaru Telescope on Maunakea that utilizes Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) as the enabling technology for high contrast imaging. MEC is the first permanently deployed near-infrared MKID instrument and is designed to operate both as an IFU, and as a focal plane wavefront sensor in a multi-kHz feedback loop with SCExAO. The read noise free, fast time domain information attainable by MKIDs allows for the direct probing of fast speckle fluctuations that currently limit the performance of most high contrast imaging systems on the ground and will help MEC achieve its ultimate goal of reaching contrasts of 10−7 at 2 λ/D. Here we outline the instrument details of MEC including the hardware, firmware, and data reduction and analysis pipeline. We then discuss MEC’s current on-sky performance and end with future upgrades and plans.},

	abstract = {MagAO-X is a visible to near-IR AO system that will enable a suite of instruments to perform high-contrast, high-resolution science. During its "Phase II" plan a 10-kilopixel Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector (MKID) IFU will be deployed as a science camera behind MagAO-X. MKIDs are photon-counting detectors with energy resolution up to 30. The photon counting capability and readout allow for microsecond time resolution with no associated read noise. As a consequence of the high readout rate the MKID camera can be used as a Focal Plane Wavefront Sensor (FPWFS) allowing real-time speckle control while simultaneously taking science observations. With the high resolution and contrasts delivered by MagAO-X the MKID camera will aim to directly image and characterize exoplanets in the near-IR. The camera's IR filters can also be replaced with visible filters that will allow for further characterization and the potential for exploration of the inner regions of circumstellar disks.},

	abstract = {We report on the design and development progress of two Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector (MKID) integral field spectrographs (IFSs) for high-contrast astronomy applications. DARKNESS is a 10,000 pixel MKID IFS that will integrate with the coronagraphs at Palomar Observatory, as well as directly with the Palm- 3000 (P3K) extreme adaptive optics (AO) system. MEC is a 20,440 pixel MKID IFS that will integrate with the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme AO (SCExAO) system at the Subaru Telescope. Both IFSs are optimized for 700 to 1400 nm bandpasses to provide low resolution spectroscopy across I and J bands. MKIDs are a promising technology for overcoming the current contrast ceiling in coronagraphic instruments imposed by atmospheric speckles that vary on 1-second timescales. These speckles vary too slowly to average out with long exposures, and too quickly to control in real time with conventional focal plane detectors or to subtract reliably with differential imaging. With these instruments we will demonstrate how the high time resolution of MKIDs allows focal plane speckle nulling at the speed necessary to control atmospheric speckles in real time, and discrimination of speckles from faint companions during post-processing using statistical techniques similar to the “dark speckle” approach. Additionally, the energy resolution of MKIDs allows either form of speckle suppression to be applied as a function of wavelength. First-light for DARKNESS is scheduled for July 2016 and first-light for MEC is targeted for Fall 2016/Winter 2017.},

	abstract = {High-order topological phases of matter refer to the systems of \$n\$-dimensional bulk with the topology of \$m\$-th order, exhibiting \$(n-m)\$-dimensional boundary modes and can be characterized by topological pumping. Here, we experimentally demonstrate two types of second-order topological pumps, forming four 0-dimensional corner localized states on a 4\${\textbackslash}times\$4 square lattice array of 16 superconducting qubits. The initial ground state of the system for half-filling, as a product of four identical entangled 4-qubit states, is prepared using an adiabatic scheme. During the pumping procedure, we adiabatically modulate the superlattice Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian by precisely controlling both the hopping strengths and on-site potentials. At the half pumping period, the system evolves to a corner-localized state in a quadrupole configuration. The robustness of the second-order topological pump is also investigated by introducing different on-site disorder. Our work studies the topological properties of high-order topological phases from the dynamical transport picture using superconducting qubits, which would inspire further research on high-order topological phases.},
